# YGGTorrent searcher

YGGTorrent is a server/extension application that allows downloading file from the extension provided

It is particularly useful if you have a _seedbox_ watching for new file in a given folder

### Getting started

Have a look at the `config/config.js` file to indicate, according to the URL, the final path of the file

- Download the YGG Torrent Downloader extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ygg-torrent-searcher-exte/ljpelodjbjjlolngdkilhgjcajlknhcj)
- Set the IP of your server by clicking the extension and hitting update once the input has been filled

> Note that you can load the extension unpackaged through [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in developper mode with the `extension/manifest.json` of the repo

### Usage

After the extension is installed, you can see download links added to the yggtorrent website that allows you to download directly to the application.
